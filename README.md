# High-Tech-Geopolitics---PLI-Schemes
## Data on PLI Schemes 

In the Google Sheets called [PLI Schemes](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dzfMooGIABD8TSrMGS6b39S-OzzlNqRMSjvStc18ojg/edit#gid=0) attached, we collect and assimilate data about the various PLI schemes that the Union government started to introduce after 2021.
Production Linked Incentives were introduced by the government to boost domestic manufacturing in specific sectors by giving monetary incentives. 14 sectors were selected - Automobiles and Auto Components, Aviation, Chemicals, Electronic Systems, Electronics manufacturing, IT hardware, Food processing, Medical Devices, Metals and Mining, Pharmaceuticals, Renewable energy, Telecom, Textiles and Apparel and White goods. The total outlay of the schemes was Rs 1.97 lakh crore. 

Data is collected from government websites, articles and press releases by the government, links have been given. 
The data points in red are sourced from a Press Release (https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1710134) by the Union Government. 
The data which we couldn't get has been marked by a '-'.
